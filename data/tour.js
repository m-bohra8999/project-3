      overview: `<p>What captivates travellers about Rajasthan? We believe it’s the element of surprise. Rajasthan is one of the few places in the world where no two experiences are the same. Where on one trip you could be enjoying tea in a royal palace, on another you could be traversing the thick jungles of Ranthambore. But, what remains same is the vibrant culture and the heartwarming hospitality of the locals.</p>
                                        <p>Located in western India, Rajasthan tourism promises memorable experiences for all kinds of travellers and you'd be surprised at the variety of things to do here. Home to the Pink City of Jaipur, the City of Lakes, Udaipur, the picturesque hill station of Mount Abu, the beautiful Ranthambore National Park and the land of sand dunes, Jaisalmer – Rajasthan tourism offers experiences that become part of your journey.</p>`,
